                    Ones ethic must be driven by intellectual honesty and a
                    ceaseless will to self-educate. Mentality built from this
                    ethic should recognize its prevailing cognitive ceiling as
                    temporary, existing only to be replaced by a deeper sense of
                    knowledge and understanding.

                      I do not have a Computer Science degree and prior to
                      February 2012, I did not possess any experience in
                      software development.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Today, I build big data solutions for both small-scale and
                      Fortune 500 customers using SQL, PowerShell, Python,
                      C#/.NET and STEALTHbits products. I've also acquired
                      skills in JavaScript, HTML and CSS that I've used in
                      building a number of applications in Node and React.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      In February 2012, I was offered a Quality Assurance
                      Enginner position at STEALTHbits Technologies Inc. Soon
                      after I accepted the offer, I quickly realized that my
                      natural tendency to identify, analyze, and resolve
                      problems aligned very well with software testing. With the
                      help of a mentor, I learned about the rules constructing
                      our applications; written logic we call code, which I used
                      to strengthen my testing skill and perspective. This
                      foundation shaped how I would approach client-facing roles
                      in the future and served as an important backbone to many
                      high-visibility projects I would work on.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      After 1.5 years in the Quality Assurance role, I was
                      approached by our CEO where he asked if I would transition
                      from QA into a client-facing Professional Services role.
                      Although itâ€™s not uncommon for an employee to receive a
                      promotion, this request was important for two main
                      reasons:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        Personal recognition from the CEO of a 200+ employee
                        company at the time.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The companies first override of their typical transition
                        process of QA > Support > Professional Services.
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      I spent approx. 2.5 years in this role, both leading and
                      assisting in 25+ installations, configurations, and
                      customizations of enterprise-level security software
                      within both large and small-scale unstructured data
                      environments.
                    </p>
